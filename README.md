# django-formClass-cw

Start from stratch for this one.

Create a form for an Employee Application. Give it a name, date of birth, position applying to, and salary. On the home page (index), in large letters say "Employee Application" and show the employee Form with a submit button. On a different page, list all of the entered information. Use only one function in your views file to handle the get and post request. Style the page so all of the text isn't on one line.
